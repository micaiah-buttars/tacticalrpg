Ice Emblem at the moment is just a one person project. It is my playground, to improve the quality of the software I write and to test new ideas.
However if something good will ever come out of this mess, that would probably make me happy.

About the game
==============

Ice Emblem aims to be something similar to the Fire Emblem series.
At the moment I don't think much about all the the fine stories and dialogues between characters, but more about the gameplay itself.

As you can see the basic gameplay available is really similar to Fire Emblem's.
However everything can always change. In fact I played Shattered Throne and loved its deterministic approach.
Then I played The Battle for Wesnoth, which is a really fine libre turn based strategy game, that uses hexagonal maps and has an option for determinism.

What I don't like about non deterministic approach is the fact that one time a move may lead to a loss, while the same exact move sometime is a win.
In fact I really hated the latest Fire Emblems' "hard mode" because of this. "Uh, I lost, I'm gonna try again, this time I might get a critical.".

Deterministic games don't have this problem. If you failed, than you know you must change strategy.
